# android-volley
Uses volley HTTP library to make simple httprequests to an express webserver.

I did not add the express webserver in here, but it is easy to make one. To run it, just type npm start in 
the root directory of the express server. 

Adjust the domain accordingly in res/xml/network_security_config.xml under the <domain> tag.
