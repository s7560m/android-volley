# android-volley
Uses volley HTTP library to make simple httprequests to an express webserver.

I did not add the express webserver in the master branch, but in the other branch new_branch. It is easy to make one. To run it, just type npm start in the root directory of the express server. 

Adjust the domain accordingly in res/xml/network_security_config.xml within the <domain> tag. This is just used for testing to see
if I can make http requests on android.
